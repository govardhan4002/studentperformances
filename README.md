# 📚 Student Performance Risk Analysis

This project is based on analyzing student performance data to find out which students may be at **academic risk**. The goal is to support schools and teachers by identifying students who may need extra help early.

## 📌 Project Objective

To explore and understand the data related to students' academic marks and detect which students are performing low or need support. This can help in **early intervention** for better results.

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries Used

- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn

## 📊 What I Did

1. **Loaded the dataset** – containing student information.
2. **Cleaned the data** – removed missing values and checked the data types.
3. **Explored the data** – used graphs and statistics to understand patterns.
4. **Found insights** – figured out which students are performing low.
5. **Visualized results** – using bar charts and plots for better understanding.

## 🧠 Key Insights

- Some students had **very low marks** and may be **at risk**.
- Attendance, study time, and other factors can affect performance.
- Visualizations made it easy to **spot patterns** and problem areas.
